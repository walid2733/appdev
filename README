1. Configuration Instructions

The application is running on a Raspberry Pi 3 model B. This pi should come with a USB sound card, a network connection, a microphone.

1.1 Configure USB sound card as defult audio device:
1.1.1 Boot up RPi, and apply the USB sound card. Use .lsusb. command to check if your USB sound card is mounted:

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ lsusb
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 0d8c:000c C-Media Electronics, Inc. Audio Adapter
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0424:ec00 Standard Microsystems Corp. SMSC9512/9514 Fast Ethernet Adapter
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0424:9514 Standard Microsystems Corp.
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

1.1.2 Use .sudo nano /etc/asound.conf.command and put following content to the file:

pcm.!default {
  type plug
  slave {
    pcm "hw:1,0"
  }
}
ctl.!default {
    type hw
    card 1
}

1.1.3 Go to your home directory. Use .nano .asoundrc. command and put the same content to the file.

1.1.4 Run .alsamixer. you should be able to see that USB sound card is the default audio device. For a more sensitive sound detection, it is better to maximize the volume of .Mic..

1.1.5 Fix the Bug of arecord

1.1.6 The newest version of Raspbian (a.k.a. Jessie) comes with a new version of alsa-utils (1.0.28), which has a bug while recording: it doesn.t stop even a 
'.duration' switch is given, and generates lots of useless audio files. To fix this problem, we have to downgrade alsa-util to an earlier version (1.0.25).

1.1.7

1.2 Install Libcurl library
